# TEKTE-Net: Takens-Based Kernel Transfer Entropy Connectivity Network

This repository contains the source code and experimental notebooks developed as part of the research work presented in the paper **“TEKTE-Net: A Takens-Based Kernel Transfer Entropy Connectivity Network for EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification”**.

The project explores a novel deep learning framework for **EEG functional connectivity analysis**, combining **Takens embedding**, **kernelized Transfer Entropy**, and **convolutional neural architectures** (EEGNet and LeNet branches) to capture **directed, nonlinear, and frequency-specific dependencies** across brain regions during motor imagery tasks.

---

## Overview

TEKTE-Net introduces a hybrid architecture designed to:
- Reconstruct **time-frequency EEG dynamics** via Takens embeddings.  
- Estimate **directed functional connectivity** using a kernelized Transfer Entropy formulation.  
- Fuse **spatial-temporal information** through deep convolutional encoders (LeNet-style and EEGNet-style).  
- Enhance **inter-subject generalization** through latent-space regularization and multi-loss optimization.  

The model was evaluated on public BCI datasets such as **BCI Competition IV-2a** and **GigaScience MI-DBIII**, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over baseline methods.
